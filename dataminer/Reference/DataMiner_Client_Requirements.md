### Skyline certificates

To install the Skyline certificates:

1. Depending on your setup, go to either of the following URLs, replacing [DMA] with the IP address or name of the DataMiner Agent:

   - http://[DMA]/tools

   - https://[DMA]/tools

1. Under *DataMiner Tools*, click *Register Skyline Certificates*, and then click *Run*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU12]/10.5.3 onwards<!--RN 41844-->, this tool is no longer available.
> - Running this tool is an optional security precaution.
> - The tool will try to install the certificates for all users of the computer. If this is not possible because of insufficient rights, it will try to install the certificates for the current user only.
> - When the installation is complete, a message "Certificates have been installed (current user)" or "Certificates have been installed (all users)" will be displayed.
> - This tool (SLRegCerts.exe) also supports a "/silent" option that suppresses any message box output, so that it can be used in automatic installations.

Optional software, only to be installed for users who will be creating or adapting Microsoft Visio drawings.
